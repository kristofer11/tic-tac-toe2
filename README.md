# tic-tac-toe2
Building another tic-tac-toe game with as little help with logic as possible and a better UI.

James Q Quick's youtube channel was helpful in laying out the board.

Next steps:
1. Prompt players to enter names
2. Provide the option to play against the computer or with another player.
3. Three(?) difficulty levels for computer play: easy(chooses randomly), medium(blocks potential wins?), and hard(algorithm for best move each turn?)
